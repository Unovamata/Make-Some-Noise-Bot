For this, you must download the installer and execute it in your machine. Do not change the default installation folder, else this program will not work. When you navigate to the Tesseract page, make sure to find the following **setup.exe** URL.

# Setup

+ Download the files above and install TesseractOCR and Python.
+ Make sure you configure the PATH for Python and [TesseractOCR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kWvk4C1pMo). In the case of Python you can do this through the installer so read **carefully** to not skip this step.
+ Once you have installed Python and configured its respective **"Environment Variable"**, run the **"install dependencies.bat"** file. This file will install all the libraries Python needs tp run the bot.
+ After the **"install dependencies.bat"** window closes, open the **"run.bat"** file in the bot's files.
+ With that you're ready to configure the bot.
